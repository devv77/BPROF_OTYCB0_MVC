# MVC And WPF APP Project
This was my first bigger project in my university.
It consist a web page made in ASP.NET and an WPF application.
The web page is very simple and coded in HTML. For stlye I used some CSS, but it wasn't about looks. The code worked well.
The WPF app was created for database uses, there was a different class for this. I know that this is an older application, but we must work with it.
The database behind it was a simple MSSQL generated from code.
We used a lot of different querries and JSON conversions.

This project was created in 2020/2021.
